        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
            iKitty Life is a startup organization registered with registrars of companies on 27th 
            Sept. 2019. The organization is founded by 3 individuals i.e. Ms. Rashida Muse Moseka, 
            Ms. Atizuyo Janeth and Mr. Godwin Ocen who were angered by the high rate of teenage 
            pregnancies in refugeesâ€™ settlements and hosting communities of West Nile region of 
            Uganda and hungrily developed teen-centred programs to reduce the statistics.

                We provide capacity development training for disadvantaged teenagers and their groups 
                with focus on ensuring they have access to correct teen friendly information on sexual 
                reproductive health and rights so that they become resilient, empowered and bold enough 
                to take and own healthy sexual decisions.
